# MacToggle

Create Mac OS toggles with the user interaction, design and animation of the iOS UISwitch. Completely configurable through quick understandable code. With access to the source, you are able to add more custom features if you want. If their are any tweaks that you feel should be enabled then send me over a PR and I will have a look. **Swift 3 Ready**

## Setup

Nothing complicated, copy the MacToggle folder over to your project.


## Sample Code

```swift
let toggle: MacToggle = {
	let view = MacToggle()
	view.isOn = true
	view.fillColor = .black
	return view
}()
```
There are plenty of settings you can play with, have fun and create the designs that you require for your Mac OS developments. Here are a couple of designs, for ideas:
